# Cooling System Checks (ODES 800)

**Symptoms:** Overheating at slow speeds, recovery at cruise.

**Checklist**
- Bleed the system (nose-up).
- Verify fan direction and shroud seal.
- Inspect CVT outlet heat near rad.
- Pressure test cap and check for flow at idle.
- Confirm coolant type and mix.

**Field tip:** A clean rad and proper shroud seal matter more than “bigger fan” in most cases.

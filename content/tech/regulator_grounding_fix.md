# Regulator Grounding Fix (ODES 800)

**Why:** Heat + paint on the frame can cause poor grounding and low charging voltage.

**Quick steps**
- Remove regulator and scrape paint to bare metal.
- Install a star washer between frame and regulator.
- Add a ground jumper from regulator case to battery negative.
- Test voltage at idle and 4000 rpm; aim for 13.8â€“14.5V warm.

**Notes**
If the stator plug is heat-damaged, relocate the rectifier/regulator to a cooler spot and inspect wire gauge on the harness side.
